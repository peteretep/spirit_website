Sligo Bay is home to many species of fish, and the crew on Spirit know all the good fishing grounds in the area. There are vast areas of sand and shingle, home to many species of flat fish. <b>Turbot</b>, <b>Ray</b> and <b>Skate</b> are common.</br> <b>Flounder</b>, <b>Place</b> and <b>Dab</b> are also common near any of the three estuaries. <b>Tope</b> are also visitors to these estuaries from March right through to November. We are also lucky to have several reefs in the bay, with the usual species lurking. 
</p>
        <b>Mackerel</b> usually arrive from mid April and make for fun fishing and fabulous eating but also great bait for everything from <b>Pollack</b> to <b>Shark</b>.
</p> From the MV Spirit you can fish from all sides, meaning that even with a full complement of passengers there is room for all to fish. Of course, there is the added attraction of arriving safely, quickly and in dry comfort at your fishing grounds. 
        
</p>M.V. Spirit carries a selection of rods and reels, feathers and baits. All are available to hire or buy

    <div id="review"> Brought a group of 2 adults & 7 kids age 11-13 for my son's birthday for an afternoon's fishing. Absolutely fantastic day, very friendly, helpful, informative & a great boat, very well equipped and organised. I cannot recommend it highly enough- Kids all caught buckets of Mackeral (they gutted & cooked and ate with chips for their party) + a few other species- took a detour to see the Grey Seals at seal rock. Reasonably priced. Do it!! - Nick Miller
